# Differences Between an Active Project & Inactive Project in the PhoneGap App Desktop

![Project Listing](https://raw.github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/master/docs-assets/active/docs-active-project.png)

## Active Project

The active project is the project that the PhoneGap App Desktop will serve in its local server. The PhoneGap App Desktop uses a green bar on the left side of the active project and also a slightly darker shade of grey to highlight the active project in the PhoneGap App Desktop's project list.

## Inactive Project

An inactive project is a project that has been loaded into the PhoneGap App Desktop, but is not the project that is currently being served by PhoneGap App Desktop's local server.

## Switching the Active Project

There are a few ways to change the active project in the PhoneGap App Desktop:

1. Clicking on the Play icon in the project that you wish to activate
1. Adding or opening a project will make the newly added / opened project the active project
