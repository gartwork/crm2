![Project Listing](https://raw.github.com/hermwong/phonegap-gui/master/docs-assets/active/docs-active-project.png)

## Active Project

The active project is the project that the PhoneGap GUI will serve in its local server. The PhoneGap GUI uses a green bar on the left side of the active project and also a slightly darker shade of grey to highlight the active project in the PhoneGap GUI's project list.

## Inactive Project

An inactive project is a project that has been loaded into the PhoneGap GUI, but is not the project that is currently being served by PhoneGap GUI's local server.

## Switching the Active Project

There are a few ways to change the active project in the PhoneGap GUI:

1. Clicking on the Play icon in the project that you wish to activate
1. Adding or opening a project will make the newly added / opened project the active project
