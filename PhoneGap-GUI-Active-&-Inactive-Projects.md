# Differences Between an Active Project & Inactive Project in the PhoneGap GUI

## Active Project

The active project is the project that the PhoneGap GUI will serve in its local server. The PhoneGap GUI uses a green light icon on the right side of the active project and also a slightly darker shade of grey to highlight the active project in the PhoneGap GUI's project list.

## Inactive Project

An inactive project is a project that has been loaded into the PhoneGap GUI, but is not the project that is currently being served by PhoneGap GUI's local server. The PhoneGap GUI uses a yellow light icon on the right side of the project to indicate that the project's inactive state.
