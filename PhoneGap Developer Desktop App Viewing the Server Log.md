## How to View the Local Server Logs

To view the server log, you will need to have at least one project loaded into the PhoneGap Developer Desktop App. The PhoneGap Developer Desktop App will automatically start the local server for the active project.

When the local server is online the PhoneGap Developer Desktop App will display a green icon with the local server's IP address and port number in the footer.
